# Note
 - make sure you have [the gcc from tdb (in 32 bit)](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/) setted up correctly in your windows machine. 
 - you would also need ``winmm`` library linked and passed in with the ``-lwinmm`` flag.
 - and finally, it doesn't work on other platforms other that windows.
